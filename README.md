# ImgurClient
An Imgur client for experimenting with trendy libraries, especially rx java.

### Project Focus
My main goal with this project was to play with rx-java observers.  Im also using Dagger to facilitate dependency injection, Retrofit for the imgur api, Picasso for Images, Gson for parsing, Butterknife for view injection, Design support library for material design stuff, and RecyclerView.
