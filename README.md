# ImgurClient
An Imgur client for experimenting with trendy libraries.

### Project Focus
My main goal with this project was to play with the currently trendy libraries.  Im using Dagger to facilitate dependency injection, Retrofit for the imgur api, RxJava for callbacks, Picasso for Images, Gson for parsing, Butterknife for view injection, Design support library for material design stuff, and RecyclerView.

### Intended core feature set
* Browse galleries - switch between galleries
* Endless ViewPager for galleries
* Sign into account
* Automaticly upload images when image captured (Screen shots!)
